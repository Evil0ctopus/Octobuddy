# OctoBuddy (working title)

OctoBuddy is a cute, funny, slightly chaotic creature–AI hybrid that learns and grows with me as I study cybersecurity, Python, and WGU courses.

Inspired by projects like Pwnagotchi (agent loop, plugins, personality), but focused entirely on **safe, legal learning**. OctoBuddy acts as a study companion, XP tracker, and code-explaining buddy as it evolves alongside my skills.

## Early goals

- Track study sessions and earned XP
- Show mood, level, and evolving personality
- React to events (studied Python, finished a class, etc.)
- Run in the terminal at first, then expand to richer UIs
- Eventually:
  - Help explain code I give it
  - Evolve new abilities as I learn new skills (Security+, bug bounties, CTFs)

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/demo_run.py
